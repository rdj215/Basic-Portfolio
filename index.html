      <p> Hello, My name is Ryan Jamison, I was born and raised in Philadelphia, PA. I'm currently learning how to program which is alot harder than I expected it to be, however I'm excited to see how I devlope my skills over the next 12 weeks.
      <p>My goal is to one day build my own app that will help make a difference in people lives. Attending coding bootcamp is the start of this goal, and based on my current skill level I have a long way to go. </p>

      <p>In my spare time I enjoy reading, working out, and spending time with family. I love to watch action, horror, and sci-fi movies when i get a chance to watch television which isn't often these days.  </p>
